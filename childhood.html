    <h2>Where It All Started</h2>
    <p>
        My childhood was filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable experiences that helped shape the person I am today.
        I was born and raised in <strong>Lamu County</strong>, in a small town known as <strong>Witu</strong>. 
        The area is rich in culture, heavily influenced by Arabs and Muslims because of its close connection to the Indian Ocean and coastal traditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Growing up in Witu taught me simplicity, humility, and the importance of community. 
        It was a peaceful environment where children played freely, families knew each other, and culture was deeply celebrated.  
        I also attended my early school years in the same county, which strengthened my roots and connection to home.
